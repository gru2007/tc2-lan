# About this fork
## EN
I have created this fork to run TC2 in limited OSes, like on school or work. It uses GBE Emulator to rrmove requirement on SteamClient and internet. Steam Networking works on LAN connection.

I have tested on RedOS (Russian shitty OS), Windows and it works. I don't have time to write a guide, so if you are interested write to my Telegram https://artemevkhv.t.me — I'll answer on English.

## RU
Я создал этот форк для запуска TC2 в ограниченных операционных системах, например, в школе или на работе. Он использует эмулятор GBE для удаления требований к SteamClient и Интернету. Сеть Steam работает по локальной сети.

Я протестировал на RedOS (русский Linux) и Windows - TC2 работает. У меня нет времени писать руководство, поэтому, если вам интересно, напишите мне в Telegram https://artemevkhv.t.me — Я отвечу на русском.

# Team Comtress 2

A mod for Team Fortress 2 to fix bugs, improve performance, and add quality of life, with the goal of having those changes pulled upstream by Valve to the modern game. This mod helps us test features, and helps users have an area where they can enjoy the changes and get involved.

We're also experimenting with continuing support work for gameplay balance and other game features. While this is outside of the original scope of the project, we think it's an area we can create value for players of the mod and the community. We won't be submitting these changes to Valve, though they may inform other changes more in line with the original project.

## How can I help?

1. Report bugs you'd like to see fixed in TF2 or TC2 through the issues page.
2. Suggest quality of life improvements (but not balance changes) through the issues page.
3. Install TC2 and play the game to test stability, bug fixes, performance, and enjoyment.

## Installation

1. Install the [itch.io app](https://itch.io/app)
2. Download [Team Comtress 2](https://mastercoms.itch.io/tc2) through the app to get auto-updates
3. Get Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer under Tools in the Steam Library
4. You can now play Team Comtress 2 in the itch app!
